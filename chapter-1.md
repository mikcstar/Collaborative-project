It’s evening 5’O clock, I standing on the bridge waiting for my friend who planned for a movie.

Its was very pleasant and lovely climate which made my heart lite. I started roaming on the bridge and thinking about my friend is he come or not. Suddenly I surprised a girl crossed my sight, I turn around and watched her she was very beautiful,charming and cute.

She stand a few meters far away from me and looking into the water below the bridge and my eyes saw her face which face bright as the moon in full moon day and my heart beat raised, I supposed that she was waiting for some one.

I decided to try my luck,immediately I took my phone out and send msg “How much time?” and I got a reply “nearly half n hour “, thank god it will be a great time for me…

What should I do now,my heart beat raised my heart says “Go and talk with her” can I?

No I cannot… it again says “don’t miss her , nothing happen when u go and have a small talk”

Its ok I decided to talk with her I myself “All is Well’.
